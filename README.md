### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amir Elemam, a **Full Stack Software Engineer**, mainly focused on backend solutions.

Some other titles I have are B.Sc. of Biomedical Informatics, AWS Certified Developer - Associate, Microsoft Certified Professional and OpenJS Node.js Services Developer.

I currently work with **Node.js** and **React.js**, while I have worked with Python, C#, Vue.js, PHP and C in the past.

Although my undergrad was focused on Health Care and that's the industry I have more experience with, I've also worked with Marketing, Customer Service, Telecommunications and Taxation.

Some of the technologies/tools I have worked with are:

> Backend with Node.js & Express.js  
> Frontend with React.js, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4  
> Development of RESTful APIs  
> Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, Firebase)  
> Real-time system integration (Websocket & HTTP)  
> Automated tests: jest, mocha, chai, joi, sinon, istambul, stryker  
> Version control: git, gitflow  
> DevOps: Docker, docker-compose, AWS (S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, ECR, ECS)  
> Code style & quality: ESLint, git hooks, prettier, AirBnB, StandardJS  
> Agile Methodologies: Scrum, Kanban  
> Agile Tools: Trello, Jira, ClubHouse  
> Other: NLP (Microsoft LUIS), Design Patterns, API Security, SendGrid, Certbot

You can reach me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirelemam) and read my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@amirelemam).

Fun fact: I was the 30th person in the world to get the OpenJS Node.js Services Developer (JSNSD) certification.
